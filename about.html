            Hello, my name is Trey. I am a serial hobbyist. I enjoy doing active things, most recently biking. I am also addicted to coffee,
            finding good donuts, and love making stromboli.

          I have 3 sisters and we all have the same initials(TLC). I got married to my better half, Sarah, in 2021. And we were both raised
          in Westerville, OH. I was born in Kentucy. I still visit Kentucky and love everything about it, but maybe most, I love the Kentucky 
          Wild Cats.

            I attended Columbus State Community college after high school from 2015-2017. I never really decided a major 
            though so I started to sell insurance for my fathers company. I didn't really like that too much. I then started to work in
            HVAC from 2020-2022. This job was okay, but just too brutal on my large body. So I had many friends go to a bootcamp to learn 
            developing and they all reccomended I do the same. And by my 3rd week in the program I was able to see it was the best
            decision I made in my career. I am looking forward to starting my career in tech. Hopefully you'll read this and want to
            reach out.
